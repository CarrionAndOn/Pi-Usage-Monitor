# Linux Usage Monitor
A python script that monitors the temperature (if on Pi), RAM usage, and CPU usage of a linux system and sends it through a Discord webhook every minute.  <br />
If you're concerned about bandwidth, the script takes up 1.728 MB a <b>month</b> on average. <br />

# Installation
<b>THIS WILL ONLY WORK ON RASPBERRY PI.</b>
### `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SoulWithMae/Linux-Usage-Monitor/main/install.sh && bash install.sh`<br />
It will install any dependencies for you if you do not already have them, do not worry about installing them.<br />
If the OS you installed onto your Pi has a graphic desktop, you can download it directly from the releases.<br />
Or, you can install it manually with the instructions below.<br />

# Manual Installation
<b>NOTE: I HAVE ONLY TESTED THIS IN UBUNTU, NO IDEA IF IT WORKS IN ANY OTHER LINUX DISTROS.</b><br />
psutil MUST be installed for this to work.<br />
Install it with "pip install psutil"<br />
If you don't have pip, install python3-pip with "apt install python3-pip"<br />
<br />
Run `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CarrionAndOn/Linux-Usage-Monitor/main/usagemonitor.py`<br />
Run `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CarrionAndOn/Linux-Usage-Monitor/main/usagemonitor.conf`<br />
Run `nano usagemonitor.conf`<br />
Change YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL to the URL of your discord webhook.<br />
Change the time to whatever you want it to be in seconds, or leave it.<br />
Change "yes/anything_else" to "yes" if you're installing it on a Pi, or literally anything if it's not on a pi.<br />
<b>IT MUST BE LOWERCASE.</b><br />
Run `mv usagemonitor.py /opt/`<br />
Run `mv usagemonitor.conf /opt/`<br />
Run the file with "python3 /opt/usagemonitor.py" to make sure it works<br />
Use systemctl, supervisor, nohup, or any other service daemon to run the file in the background<br />
An example service file for systemctl is in the source code.<br />

# Configuration
If you want to change the webhook URL or the time between each message after install, just edit the `usagemonitor.conf` file<br />
It is located in /opt/ usually, unless you changed the directories in the scripts.<br />

# Uninstallation
Run `systemctl stop usagemonitor && rm /opt/usagemonitor.* && rm /etc/systemd/system/usagemonitor.service`<br />

# Windows?
With some modification to the script, it can work on windows.<br />
It all has to be manually installed, the automatic install was written for Linux and won't work on Windows.<br />
Change the config directory in the script to be "./usagemonitor.conf" instead of /opt/usagemonitor.conf".<br />
The config file will be regular, the Pi value CANNOT be "yes", put it as anything but yes.<br />
I do not know any programs that run python scripts in the background on Windows, you will have to figure that out yourself.<br />
If something breaks, this script was written with Linux in mind and not Windows, so expect that.<br />
